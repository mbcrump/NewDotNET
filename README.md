##Mobile Apps with Visual Studio

[AppBuilder](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder/sample-apps) | [Get the App for your device](http://docs.telerik.com/platform/appbuilder/getting-started/app-in-minutes-with-inbrowser-client)

[Telerik UI for Xamarin](https://github.com/mbcrump/XamarinChart) | [Download Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/)

1. Using AppBuilder, download the app for your device (iOS, Android, WP)
2. Download the [VS Extension for AppBuilder](http://docs.telerik.com/platform/appbuilder/getting-started/app-in-minutes-with-vsix) and select the Side Drawer Template and modify a view. Launch it in the Simulator to view your changes.  
3. Additionally, modify one of the [sample apps](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder/sample-apps) and use LiveSync to deploy it onto your device. 
4. Create your first Xamarin.Forms Application by navigating to Mobile Apps -> Xamarin.Forms (Portable). Right click any platform and launch the app. Go back to the "Portable" Project and modify the text to say something else. As a bonus, create a MainPage.xaml in the "Portable Project" that each platform uses. 
5. Try adding our Chart to the Application by either looking at the [docs](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/xamarin/controls/chart/chart-getting-started) or my sample project located above.
